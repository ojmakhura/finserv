       "\"The Botswana Banking Act of 1995 governs a wide range of financial and banking services.  Based on the provided text, these services can be categorized as follows:\\n\\n**I. Core Banking Services:**\\n\\n* **Acceptance of Deposits:** This is explicitly defined in the act as including deposits repayable on demand, after fixed periods, or after notice; accepted by check or other means.  This covers various deposit accounts, including demand deposits (checking accounts), savings accounts, and time deposits.\\n\\n* **Extension of Credit:** This encompasses loans, advances, overdrafts, and other similar credit facilities.  The act details regulations and limitations on these, including unsecured loans, limits on lending to individuals and related parties, and requirements for security.\\n\\n* **Investment Activities:**  The act allows banks to make investments, though it specifies limitations and restrictions on certain types of investments, such as those in the bank's own shares or those of other banks, and investments in other businesses.  The act also mandates the maintenance of specified investments (in government securities) and minimum liquid assets.\\n\\n* **Discounting of Negotiable Instruments:**  This includes discounting commercial paper, securities, and other negotiable instruments to extend credit facilities.\\n\\n\\n**II. Ancillary Banking Services (implied or related to regulation):**\\n\\n* **Foreign Exchange Transactions:** While not explicitly listed as a service, the act regulates these transactions, indicating that banks are involved in them.\\n\\n* **Safe Deposit Box Services:** The act addresses the procedures for renting safe deposit boxes, including customer identification requirements.\\n\\n* **Trust and Fiduciary Services:** The act mentions the bank's role as a trustee or fiduciary and the handling of unclaimed assets held in these capacities after winding-up.\\n\\n\\n**III. Services related to Bank Operations and Management (not directly offered to the public but crucial to the industry):**\\n\\n* **Establishment and Operation of Branches and Subsidiaries:**  The act governs the licensing and regulatory requirements for banks to establish and operate branches and subsidiaries both within and outside Botswana.  It includes regulations on representative offices of foreign banks.\\n\\n\\n**IV. Regulatory and Supervisory Services (performed by the Central Bank, not by individual banks):**\\n\\n* **Licensing and Regulation of Banks:** The act forms the basis for the Central Bank's licensing, supervision, and regulation of banks in Botswana.  This includes setting capital requirements, liquid asset requirements, and limitations on specific operations.\\n\\n* **Examination and Supervision of Banks:** The Central Bank has the power to conduct on-site examinations of banks to assess their financial health and compliance with the act.\\n\\n* **Temporary Management of Banks:** The Central Bank can temporarily take over the management of a bank facing financial difficulties.\\n\\n* **Winding-up and Judicial Management of Banks:** The act outlines the procedures for the winding-up or judicial management of insolvent banks, including priority of claims for depositors.\\n\\n\\nIt's important to note that this list is based solely on the provided excerpt of the Banking Act. The full act might contain details on other services.  Furthermore, while the act regulates these services, it does not necessarily mean that *all* banks will offer every single one of them.\\n\""
