      "\n",
      "**I. Core Banking Services:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Accepting Deposits:** This encompasses deposits of money repayable on demand, after fixed periods, or after notice; accepted by cheque or other means.  This is explicitly defined as part of \"banking business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Making Loans and Advances:**  This involves extending loans, advances, overdrafts, and other similar credit facilities.  The Act specifies limitations on the amount of unsecured lending and lending to related parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Investment Activities:** Employing deposits in investments is another core service. However, the Act places restrictions on certain types of investments, like acquiring share capital of other undertakings, except under specific conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Discounting Negotiable Instruments:** This includes discounting commercial paper and securities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**II.  Other Financial Services (with regulations and limitations):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Providing Credit Facilities:** This is a broad category encompassing loans, advances, and overdrafts, subject to various capital adequacy, lending limits, and security requirements detailed in the Act.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Foreign Exchange Transactions:** Though not explicitly listed as a separate service, the act regulates these transactions as it relates to reporting requirements and confidentiality, particularly for foreign banks and their affiliates.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Safe Deposit Boxes:** The Act regulates the rental of safe deposit boxes, mandating the verification of customer identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Trust Accounts:** While not a primary service, the Act acknowledges banks' involvement in managing trust accounts and outlines related regulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**III.  Services Related to Bank Operations and Regulation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Act doesn't directly define these as customer-facing services but they are critical components of the banking ecosystem:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Issuance and Renewal of Banking Licenses:** The Act lays out the process for obtaining and maintaining a banking license, including the criteria for approval, conditions of licensing, and procedures for revocation or surrender.  This is a key regulatory service of the Central Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Supervision and Examination of Banks:** The Central Bank is empowered to conduct on-site examinations of banks' operations and affairs, ensuring compliance with the Act and sound banking practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Financial Reporting and Auditing:** Banks are required to maintain detailed financial records, prepare audited annual accounts, and submit regular returns to the Central Bank.  The Act also details the role and responsibilities of audit committees and external auditors.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Management of Insolvent Banks:**  The Act provides for temporary management of banks by the Central Bank in cases of financial distress, and establishes procedures for winding-up or judicial management of insolvent banks.  It also defines the priority of claims in such situations, giving preference to depositors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**IV.  Supporting Services and Regulatory Aspects:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Control of Advertisements:**  The Act empowers the Central Bank to regulate bank advertising to prevent false or misleading claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Confidentiality of Information:** The Act mandates the confidentiality of customer information, with specific exceptions outlined for legal and regulatory purposes.  This includes provisions for disclosure to other banks for credit assessment and to regulatory bodies for investigations.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Customer Identification:** Banks are required to verify the identity of their customers when opening accounts, accepting deposits, or renting safe deposit boxes.\n",
